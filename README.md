Our program creates a 3x3 board and then displays the empty board. Then we call GetPlayerChoice which gets their choices and returns a position. The player enters a choice. An example choice is "mm" which stand for middle middle, "tl" which stands for top left and so forth. After GetPlayerChoice returns a position, PlaceMarker, will set that position with either an x or an o. The x and o are just alternating and the game lasts for 9 turns. To run the code do g++ -std-c++17 -Wall. This will create the a.out. Then do ./a.out and the program will run and simulate the Tic Tac Toe game.
